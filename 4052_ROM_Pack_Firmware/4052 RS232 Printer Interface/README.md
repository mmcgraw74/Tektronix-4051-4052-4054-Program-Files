29 April 2025 Update

I moved the previous Printer Interface ROM to Archive - @stepleton reported it did NOT work with @jdreesen's 4052 Multifunction ROM Pack
Root cause for failure - the Printer Interface ROM must start at 8000 Hex in MFM ROM Pack and previous ROM had an offset of 1000

Please use 4052 RS232 Printer Interface ROM and program it into MFM EPROM starting at address 8000 Hex.

My **4052/4054 RS-232 Printer Interface 4052F10 ROM Pack** contained a single 8Kx8 Motorola mask ROM.  The 4052 service manual schematic showed a MOSTEK 36000 ROM - so I used my MOSTEK ROM technique to read the ROM. 

To read the MOSTEK 36xxx mask ROMs - I found you can use the Data I/O Unipak and Unipak 2B FAMILY/PINOUT 27 50 with pin 21 pulled low or high to read a 4KB chunk.

I used a second ZIF socket - and carefully bent pin 21 of the socket out and used a jumper clip to clip pin 21 to ground (PIN 12) or +5V (PIN 24) to read each half of the ROM.

See the Reading the Motorola ROM photo for capturing one of the two halves of a MOSTEK ROM.

I used HxD to import the .MOT (Motorola format 82), and save the file as a .BIN file.  Then I used HxD to concatenate the two files into a single 8KB .BIN file
