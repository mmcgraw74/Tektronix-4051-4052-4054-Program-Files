# Tektronix 4054/4054A Dynamic Graphics board Option 30 and Color Enhanced Dynamic Graphics display Option 31
**************
The Tektronix 4054 introduced in 1979 had unique 19 inch direct view storage (DVST) with 4096 x 3072 vector graphics resolution.

Tektronix also introduced a Dynamic Graphics - Option 30 for the 4054 in 1979.  This board contained a 16-bit Signetics 8x300 bipolar microprocessor with a simple but powerful bit and byte manipulation instruction set with 3KB of ROM and 32KB of DRAM.  This board was mounted on top of the 4054 MAS and I/O boards as shown in the next photo.

This board accelerated the vector graphics performance of the 4054 computer more than 100x the performance of BASIC vector MOVE/DRAW commands and more than 10x the performance of the 4052R12 Graphics Enhancement ROM Pack vector MOVE/DRAW commands.  

The next two photos show the 4054 with the original green 19" DVST display, and a photo of my 4054 running my Star Wars Droids display program.

Option 30 supported multiple dynamic graphics objects (up to 32K) which could be displayed in storage mode (persistent on the display screen - without needing to be refreshed) and refresh mode (not stored, but refreshed over 30 times a second).

In 1982 Tektronix introduced the 4054 Option 31 - a new 19" DVST display with Color Enhanced Dynamic Graphics.
