# Tektronix 4054/4054A Dynamic Graphics board Option 30 and Color Enhanced Dynamic Graphics display Option 31
**************
The Tektronix 4054 introduced in 1979 had unique 19 inch direct view storage (DVST) with 4096 x 3072 vector graphics resolution.

Tektronix also introduced a Dynamic Graphics - Option 30 for the 4054 in 1979.  This board contained a 16-bit Signetics 8x300 bipolar microprocessor with a simple but powerful bit and byte manipulation instruction set with 3KB of ROM and 32KB of DRAM.  This board was mounted on top of the 4054 MAS and I/O boards as shown in the next photo.

This board accelerated the vector graphics performance of the 4054 computer more than 100x the performance of BASIC vector MOVE/DRAW commands and more than 10x the performance of the 4052R12 Graphics Enhancement ROM Pack vector MOVE/DRAW commands.  Option 30 supported multiple dynamic graphics objects (up to 32K) which could be displayed in storage mode (persistent on the display screen - without needing to be refreshed) and refresh mode (not stored, but refreshed over 30 times a second).

The next two photos show the 4054 with the original green 19" DVST display, and a photo of my 4054 running my Star Wars Droids display program.  The DVST stored vectors were in bright green.  However refresh mode vectors were drawn with less energy and were harder to see on the green display.  For example, the blinking rectangular cursor is visible in the second photo at the top right corner of the screen and it is not as bright as the stored vectors of the droids.

****************
In 1982 Tektronix introduced the 4054 Option 31 - a new 19" DVST display with Color Enhanced Dynamic Graphics.  This display had both green and red phosphors and displayed stored graphics in green and refreshed or just drawn vectors in RED+GREEN= ORANGE, that were much brighter than refresh vectors on the original green display as show in the following two photos.
