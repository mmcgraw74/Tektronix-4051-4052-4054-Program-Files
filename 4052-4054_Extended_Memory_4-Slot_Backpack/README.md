 Therefore 4050E01 ROM Expander or Jos Dreesen's 4052 Multifunction ROM Pack
 cannot be used in slot 2 of the 4-slot backpack (secondary address 51)
 but must be plugged into slot 1, 3 or 4 (41, 61, or 71 secondary addresses)

This option required the 4-slot ROM Backpack and also included the RS-232 Data Communications interface.

This option provided non-volatile file storage to the 4052A or 4054A computers with battery backup - for a minimum of 4 hours after the computer was unplugged or lost power.

The Extended Memory File Manager commands are a subset of the Tektronix 4907 Floppy Disk File Manager commands.
Built-in Diagnostic commands provide a power-up test and more thorough Extended Memory test.
