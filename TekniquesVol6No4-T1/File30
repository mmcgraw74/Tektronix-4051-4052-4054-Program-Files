                 FRIENDLY GRAPHING             REVISED: 22-NOV-82FRIENDLY GRAPHING allows a 4052/54 user to easily create, modify,save, copy,  and  draw  up  to  30  graphs per tape with up to 52events on each of up to 6 curves.Since all tape marking & graph directory building  are automatic,the user needs  minimal  4052/54  experience  to easily  use thisprogram.Using  the 4662 (and multipen option 31 if available) or the 4663plotter,  the  user can draw up to 4 graphs  on one plotter page.Many built-in calculations like running average,  moving average,sum, difference, and percentage make the normal hand calculationsunnecessary with this program.EQUIPMENT REQUIRED: 1. 4052/54 DESKTOP COMPUTER with OPTION 24(56k total memory). 2. 4631 HARDCOPIER(for normal graphs,1 per page). 3. 4662/63 PLOTTER with GPIB cable (up to 4 graphs/page).    NOTE: This program is compatible  with 4662 multi-pen opt 31.    The plotter address must be set to 1. 4. OPTIONAL: 4641/43 PRINTER  & 4052 option 10 PRINTER INTERFACE    installed in backpack slot # 51(right slot).GETTING STARTED: 1. Power up the  4052/54 DESKTOP COMPUTER, 4631 HARDCOPIER, 4641    PRINTER, and/or 4662/63 PLOTTER if used. 2. Insert the FRIENDLY GRAPHING tape, then press <AUTOLOAD>. 3. The tape will load,  the SCREEN will erase and the  tape menu    will appear.   Press  UDK  #  6 to load the FRIENDLY GRAPHING    program, or press UDK # 10 to list this manual. 4. The graph program will load,  the SCREEN will erase,  and the    PROMPT: "DATE:" will appear.  Enter the date(i.e. 22-NOV-82),    then press <RETURN>. Be certain to enter "-" where indicated.  5. The SCREEN will then erase, and the MENU will appear.    Select the  desired User Definable Key  (one of the ten white    keys in the upper left corner of the keyboard).                          NOTES:If  a  PROMPT(QUESTION) ends with a "#",  then ONLY a number or a<RETURN> is valid.IF ONLY  <RETURN>  IS  ENTERED  AFTER  A  "#", AND NO "<RETURN>="PROMPT  IS  INDICATED,  THEN THE PRESENT FUNCTION  IS  NOT  DONE,INSTEAD THE MENU IS DISPLAYED.If  the  PROMPT  ends  with  a  "?",  then  ONLY a <Y>, or <N>(or<RETURN>)  is  valid.   ANY  KEY EXCEPT <Y> (INCLUDING  <RETURN>)IMPLIES A "NO".The ZOOM feature allows the user to specify a portion  of  eventsand/or curves to display on the screen or plotter.The ZOOM feature does not alter  the  actual  data  displayed, itonly  "zooms"   in  on  the  data  of interest and thus does  notdisplay undesired data.Normally, the ZOOM  is  set to the maximum # of events and curvesdefined.  UDK # 2 can set the ZOOM to any subset of events and/orcurves desired.  ZOOM is  reset  automatically by UDK #2, as wellas any other time the graph data is altered.UDK FUNCTION 1  MENU11  LIST ALL CURVE DATA ON THE SCREEN/PLOTTER@1:/PRINTER@51:12  DRAW 2, 3, OR 4 GRAPHS ON ONE PLOTTER PAGE 2  MODIFY GRAPH PARAMETERS 3  MODIFY GRAPH LABELS13  COPY A GRAPH TO ANOTHER FRIENDLY GRAPHING TAPE 4  MODIFY CURVE PARAMETERS14  MOVE A CURVE 5  MODIFY A CURVE'S DATA15  CREATE A NEW GRAPH(& DELETE PRESENT GRAPH FROM MEMORY!!) 6  ADD(INSERT DATA BETWEEN EXISTING) DATA TO ALL CURVES16  DELETE DATA FROM ALL CURVES 7  ADD(INSERT A CURVE BEFORE) A CURVE17  DELETE A CURVE 8  LOAD A CURVE FROM THE TAPE18  SAVE A CURVE ONTO THE TAPE 9  LOAD A GRAPH FROM THE TAPE19  SAVE A GRAPH ONTO THE TAPE10  DRAW A GRAPH ON THE SCREEN20  DRAW A GRAPH ON THE PLOTTER@1:User Definable Key(UDK) FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION: 1. MENU    List the User Definable Key(UDK) MENU by function.11. LIST ALL CURVE DATA ON THE SCREEN/PLOTTER@1:/PRINTER@51:    List the present  ZOOMed range of graph data in table form on    the screen, plotter, or printer.12. DRAW 2, 3, OR 4 GRAPHS ON ONE PLOTTER PAGE    If 2 graphs are drawn, then they will be side by side.    If 3 graphs are drawn, then the 1st will go in the upper left    corner,  the  2nd  in  the  lower left corner, and the 3rd is    centered on the right side.    If  4  graphs  are drawn, then they will occupy  upper  left,    lower left, upper right,  & lower right corners respectively. 2. MODIFY GRAPH PARAMETERS    Set or Reset the following graph parameters:    A. DISPLAY G#  - Prints the GRAPH # in the upper left corner.    B. HIDDEN LINES - Lines which  fall below the  maximum  value       of the previous curves are not drawn.  NOTE: The first bar       style  curve  resets  the  hidden  curve 'horizon'  to  0.    C. STAGGER EVENT LABELS  - Stagger the 'X-AXIS' event labels.    D. ZOOM EVENTS AND/OR CURVES - Draw only a portion of a graph       using a subset of EVENTS and/or CURVES.    E. AUTO or MANUAL scale.       1. AUTO  scaling  automatically  computes  the next larger          Y-AXIS scale such that 5 Y-AXIS  labels are drawn using          multiples of 1, 2, 2.5, 5.0, or 7.5 .       2. MANUAL scaling allows the user to set  Y min & max, and          to specify the number of Y-AXIS labels.    F. X,Y, X&Y, or  no  GRID  -  Sets which,  if any, grid style       will  be  drawn.   If AUTO scaling is in effect, then  the       grids will follow  the X & Y labels.  If manual scaling is       in effect, then the  user  can  specify grids per label or       labels per grid. 3. MODIFY GRAPH LABELS    Alter the GRAPH TITLES, CURVE LABELS, or EVENT LABELS.13. COPY A GRAPH TO ANOTHER FRIENDLY GRAPHING TAPE    Load a graph from the present FRIENDLY GRAPHING tape and save    it  onto another FRIENDLY GRAPHING tape.  Graphs can  not  be    copied  onto  non-FRIENDLY  GRAPHING tapes.  Copying does not    alter the original or duplicate graph. 4. MODIFY CURVE PARAMETERS    Alter a curve's name, line type, shading(if a bar curve), and    data source(s).    To alter a bar curve's shading, re-enter the bar type(C or S)    when prompted for curve type.    To alter  data  without  changing its source(i.e.  keyboard),    re-enter its source  number (i.e. 1)  when  prompted for DATA    SOURCE.14. MOVE A CURVE    Any curve can  be  moved  after(to a higher curve number) any    other curve, but no calculated curve(type 4 or higher) can be    moved before its data source(s).   This  restriction  assures    that a curve which is calculated from a lower curve which  is    also  calculated  from  a  lower curve ends up with realistic    data, since the curves are calculated from 1 to 6. 5. MODIFY A CURVE'S DATA    Alter any data event within a  curve.   NOTE: To jump between    non-sequential data events(i.e.  from  event  10 to event 1),    enter  <J>  followed by the  event number desired(i.e. <J1>).    To 'null' a data event, enter <N>.15. CREATE A NEW GRAPH(& DELETE PRESENT GRAPH FROM MEMORY!!)    NOTE: Once started, any previous graph in memory is gone!!    To enter a new  graph,  first  enter  1ST, 2ND, FREE, X-AXIS,    LEFT Y-AXIS, & RIGHT Y-AXIS TITLES as  desired.   All  titles    are  optional.   The  1ST  & 2ND graph titles are at the top,    lines 1 and 2.  The FREE title  can  be  positioned  anywhere    within the graph,  where the upper left corner is 1,1 & other    positions  are located  by  the number of  SPACEs and RETURNs    from the upper  left  corner to that  desired position.   The    X-AXIS,  LEFT  Y-AXIS,  and  RIGHT  Y-AXIS  titles are on the    bottom,  vertical  left,  and vertical  right,  respectively.    Next,  enter  the  number of data EVENTs(X-AXIS labels).   52    maximum are allowed. Now select the EVENT label type  -- USER    INPUT;  AUTO-SEQUENCE BY NUMBERS, WEEKS, PERIODS,  or MONTHS.    Next, enter the number of curves desired - maximum of 6.  For    each curve,  enter the curve title,  line type -- COMPARATIVE    COMPARATIVE  BAR,  STACKED  BAR,  SOLID  LINE,  DASHED  LINE,    TRILINE,  or PHANTOM.  COMPARATIVE BARS stand side  by  side,    whereas STACKED  BARS  stack on top of each other.  There are    six dash patterns available.  The TRILINE is a small triangle    with a dot in its center (for data point plots).  The PHANTOM    is invisible, usually used when  only  the  results of a cal-    culation  based  on that curve which is displayed by  another    curve  is desired,  whereas  the  original curve  would  only    clutter up the graph.    Also for each curve, specify the data source:       A. KEYBOARD(User input)       B. 'CURVE' tape file       C. CONSTANT (all of a curve's data is set to one value)       D. RUNNING AVERAGE   of a previous curve        E. MOVING AVERAGE    of a previous curve       F. CUMULATIVE SUM    of a previous curve       G. LEAST SQUARES FIT of a previous curve       H. DIFFERENCE      of two previous curves       I. PERCENTAGE(%)   of two previous curves       J. AVERAGE of all previous curves       K. SUM     of all previous curves    A previous  curve is any curve which has a lower curve number    than the present curve, i.e.  curve 4 could be the PERCENTAGE    of curves 2  and 3, but could not be the percentage of curves    2 and 5.    The RUNNING AVERAGE calculates each data point based  on  the    sum  of  all  previous  data  points divided by the number of    previous data points.    The MOVING AVERAGE is like the  RUNNING  AVERAGE, except only    the n most recent data points are used for  the  calculation,    where n is the 'WINDOW'.    The CUMMULATIVE  SUM  adds  all  of  the previous data points    together to get each calculated point.    The  LEAST  SQUARES  FIT 'fits' a straight line  through  the    'average' of the previous curve's data.    The  DIFFERENCE  and  PERCENTAGE are self-evident, as are the    AVERAGE and SUM.    The graph is now ready to draw using UDK # 10 or # 20. 6. ADD(INSERT DATA BETWEEN EXISTING) DATA TO ALL CURVES    Add  data  events to all curves before the first, between the    first and last, or after the last data event.  Only 52 events    maximum per curve are allowed.16. DELETE DATA FROM ALL CURVES    Remove (for good!!) any data event from all curves. 7. ADD(INSERT A CURVE BEFORE) A CURVE    Add a new curve before, between, or  after  existing  curves.    Only 6 curves maximum per graph are allowed.17. DELETE A CURVE    Remove(for good!!) any curve from the present graph. 8. LOAD A CURVE FROM THE TAPE    Copy  the data on a 'CURVE' data file into a presently exist-    ing curve.   A 'CURVE' data file can only be created by first    saving that  curve  onto the tape using UDK # 18.  NOTE: Once    done, that curve's old data is gone!!18. SAVE A CURVE ONTO THE TAPE    Copy a curve's data onto a tape file.  The only way to copy a    curve's data between graphs is to save that curve's data onto    a 'CURVE' data  file, load in the graph to copy that data to,    and then use UDK  #  8  to  load  that  curve over one of the    graph's  existing  curves, since only one  graph  may  be  in    memory at any time.   NOTE:  Once  done, any previous data on    that tape file is gone!! 9. LOAD A GRAPH FROM THE TAPE    Copy the graph data on a 'GRAPH' tape file into memory.    NOTE: Once done, any previous graph in memory is gone!!19. SAVE A GRAPH ONTO THE TAPE    Copy the graph currently in memory onto a tape file.    NOTE: Once done, any previous data on that file is gone!!10. DRAW A GRAPH ON THE SCREEN    Display  the  present  graph  in memory onto the  screen  for    hardcopying,  if  desired.   NOTE:  Only  one  graph  can  be    displayed on the screen at any time.20. DRAW A GRAPH ON THE PLOTTER@1:    Draw the present graph in memory onto the plotter.    To draw more than one graph on one plotter page, use UDK #12. 30     ASCII   TEXT /  "   "  /   50     
