My latest Tektronix 4924 Tape Emulator PCB
---------------
The GPIB connector is mounted on the bottom of my Tektronix 4924 Tape Emulator PCB and a Pandauino 644-Narrow board on top to run my Arduino program plus a Pololu MicroSD adapter above the 644-Narrow board to hold all the Tektronix 4050 programs in multiple directories - one for each 'tape'.

The next photo shows the Tape Emulator plugged into the GPIB connector on an Agilent 34970A Data Acquisition Unit for testing with EZ-GPIB program on the PC.
