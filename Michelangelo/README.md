Tektronix 4050 Michelangelo - vector art - programs and data files
-------------
![isco37 3D Vector Graphs](./isco27-3D_graphs.png)


There are three programs in this folder: file 1 - The viewer program which will display each image and pause for five seconds between images. file 6 - The PLOT10 plt file to R12 BINARY data file conversion program file 7 - The Michael D Cranford 4051 RAMPACK .dat ASCII Fast Graphics file format to R12 BINARY file format conversion program

The Viewer and file 7 will run on any 4051 with RAMPACK or vintagetek.org MAXIROM or any 4052/4054 with Jos Dreesen's 4052/4054 Multifunction ROM Pack programmed to include the 4052R12 ROM. File 6 takes advantage of the 4052R14 GPIB Enhancement ROM Pack - which is also included in the 4051 MAXIROM from vintagetek.org, but it would be easy to add the HEXDEC with a couple of lines of BASIC.
I posted youtube videos running this program on my 4052 and 4054A:
