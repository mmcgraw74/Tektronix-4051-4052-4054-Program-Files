I finished my new demo for Vintage Computer Federation VCF Southwest June 2025 in Dallas Texas - a recreation of the Tektronix 4051 and 4081 CGI computer generated scenes for the 1978 Battlestar Galactica TV season!

I developed over eighty Tektronix 4050 BASIC computer programs and data files in the last 30 days.  Some of the programs were experiments - like displaying a bitmap of the Battlestar Galactica.  I decided it took too long to display the bitmap and manually created a vector tracing of the image using Inkscape to dramatically speed up the image.

Since I never found a Battlestar Galactica Demo Tape - I created some of the images by using Inkscape to trace the outlines of the images from my screen captures of a BSG 1978 Blu-Ray set of disks!  I then converted those images to Tektronix 4050R12 Fast Graphics format for quick display on all 4050 computers with R12 Option ROMs (including 4051 MAXIROM and 4052 Multifunction ROM Packs).

I found a MIDI BSG theme song and converted the sheet music to 4050R12 MUSIC format.

Since I have a 4054A with Option 30 Dynamic Graphics and Option 31 Color Enhanced DVST CRT - I added yellow titles to all the scenes and blinking orange rectangle cursors and blinking "CONDITION RED" text to the Battlestars under attack by Cylons scene.

I also added Vectrex gamepad support to the demo menu program - you just have to REM some lines in the program listed on line 700 to enable Vectrex gamepad support - which I will use at the show.

I also took the liberty of updating some of the scenes to use my vector graphics of Vipers, Cylon Raiders and Battlestar Galactica instead of the original "X" for Battlestars and Vipers and triangles for Cylons.

I am not aware of any Tektronix 4081 that are operational - but I'm sure my 4054A with Option 30 and Option 31 can reproduce any of the 4081 dynamic graphics scenes.
