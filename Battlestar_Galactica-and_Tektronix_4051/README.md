# Battlestar Galactica 1977 TV Series featured Tektronix 4051 computers

**************
The Tektronix 4051 vector graphics personal computer (introduced 1975) had state-of-the-art high resolution graphics and was featured in the original Battlestar Galactica TV Series.

Here is one of the scenes featuring the use of a 4051 computer by Athena.

She was asked to get a list of the some of the prisoners on the prison barge.

Here is a screenshot of her 4051 computer screen with the list.

She then pressed the Hard Copy button on the 4051 keyboard and got a print from the Tektronix 4631 Hard Copy Unit in a couple of seconds!

She then examined the printout before handing it to Colonel Tigh.
