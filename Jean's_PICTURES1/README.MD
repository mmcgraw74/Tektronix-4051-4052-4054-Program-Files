Jean Campioni requested I post his latest vector pictures for all Tektronix 4050 computers including 4051, 4052 and 4054 with either the Fast Graphics ROM included in the vintageTEK.org MAXIROM / MAXI PACK ROM Expander for 4051 or 4052R12 Graphics Enhancement ROM included in Jos Dreesen's 4052 Multifunction ROM Expander.

Jean posted a video of his 4051 running his program on youtube here:

***************

I posted Jean's pictures in a Flash Drive format zip file.
- File 1 is the picture menu program which will view all the pictures
- The pictures are in Tektronix 4050 BASIC BINARY file format.

The [Tektronix 4051 EMULATOR](https://github.com/mmcgraw74/Tektronix-4051-Emulator) can be used to view these pictures if you do NOT have a Tektronix 4050 computer with Fast Graphics/R12 ROM Pack
