Motorola 6800 Disassembler - Tektronix 4050 BASIC Program
-------------

This BASIC program was contributed to the 4050 Application Library with this abstract in Tekniques

![4052/4054 and A-series Opcode table](./MC6800%20Disassembler%20Program%20abstract.png)

I recovered this file and the example 6800 object code data file in ASCII HEX format in an Application Library tape from the estate of Jack Everson - retired Tektronix Sales Engineer.

There are four files:

1. 6800 Disassembler BASIC program with my mods to support Flash Drive for input and output files
2. Original 6800 Disassembler program - requires internal tape drive for input file.  Listing output to GPIB tape.
3. Original 6800 object code input file in ASCII HEX format
4. Disassembled listing for file 3
