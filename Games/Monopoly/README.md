I started writing a Monopoly game on a Tektronix 4051 in 1979 - but ran out of 32KB of 4051 memory just displaying the Monopoly board graphics in Tektronix 4050 BASIC.  I made a hard copy printout of my program using a Tektronix 4631 Hard Copy unit attached to the 4051.  

The 4051 and 4052 had a 12" flat screen storage tube CRT with addressable vector resolution of 1024 by 780.   


The 4054 had a 19" curved screen storage tube CRT with 4096 by 3072 addressable vector resolution!

The photo below is my 4054, 4052 and 4631 screen printer.

************************
The Tektronix 4050 series of vector graphics computers were first introduced in 1975 with the 4051 using a Motorola 6800 CPU with 32KB of BASIC ROMs and 32KB RAM integrated with a 1024x780 vector graphics display, DC-300 quarter-inch tape drive, full keyboard, two option ROM slots and GPIB interface for attaching options like plotters, digitizing tablets, floppy and hard disk systems and other GPIB peripherals from Tektronix.
