**Adventure for the Tektronix 4052 and 4054**
----------------
Credits: 

Adventure tape recovered from estate of Jack Everson
Jack was a Tektronix sales engineer in Long Island, NY.

Kurt Rosenfeld was instrumental in the recovery - contacting me, supplying lists of Tektronix 4050 tape and 8-inch floppy disk labels, and shipping the tapes I selected for recovery.

Remarks in the Adventure program indicate the author was Chuck Smith - Tektronix Graphics Computing Systems (GCS) Marketing.
Chuck indicated he modified a BASIC Adventure program he found in Creative Computing November 1979 magazine.  

The Adventure program in that magazine was written by Ben Moser, a student at James Madison High School in Vienna, Virginia!  The article indicates Ben had played the FORTRAN version of Adventure on an MIT timeshare computer.  He mapped the rooms and created his BASIC program on a timeshare HP3000 minicomputer to match the logic he saw in the game.

Chuck's modifications were to convert HP3000 BASIC code to Tektronix 4050 BASIC and convert the HP file commands to use files on the Tektronix 4050 internal DC300 data cartridge tape drive.

----
I modified Chuck's program to use my GPIB Flash Drive which emulates the Tektronix 4924 Tape Drive commands which are the same as those for the internal tape with the GPIB address of the 4924 instead of 33 used for the internal tape drive.
