This tape is from estate of Jack Everson.  Jack was a Tektronix sales engineer in Long Island, NY.  Kurt Rosenfeld was instrumental in the recovery - contacting me, supplying lists of over 100 Tektronix 4050 tape and 8-inch floppy disk labels, and shipping the tapes I selected for recovery.

Tektronix 4054 Option 30 is a Dynamic Graphics board with a 7.4MHz 8X300 Microprocessor and 32KB of DRAM.  This board increases the number of refresh vectors (Dynamic Graphics) displayable without flicker to over 2500 depending upon the vector length, as the 4054 vector generator has a constant 45 cm/second vector drawing speed.

Here is a photo of the Option 30 board installed above the 4054 MAS and I/O boards:
