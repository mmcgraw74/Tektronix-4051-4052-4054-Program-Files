This tape is from estate of Jack Everson.  Jack was a Tektronix sales engineer in Long Island, NY.  Kurt Rosenfeld was instrumental in the recovery - contacting me, supplying lists of over 100 Tektronix 4050 tape and 8-inch floppy disk labels, and shipping the tapes I selected for recovery.

Tektronix 4054 Option 30 is a Dynamic Graphics board with a 7.4MHz 8X300 Microprocessor and 32KB of DRAM.  This board increases the number of refresh vectors (Dynamic Graphics) displayable without flicker to over 2500 depending upon the vector length, as the 4054 vector generator has a constant 45 cm/second vector drawing speed.

Here is a photo of a Tektronix 4054A with the Option 31 Display.  Option 31 is the "orange" DVST tube which adds multi-color Dynamic Graphics!
Dynamic Graphics (refresh graphics on Option 30) displayed on Option 31 display are displayed in Orange phosphor, while stored graphics are displayed in Green phosphor.

Here is a video of the Helicopter Simulation program.
Note the entire helicopter is drawn in "orange" refresh vectors, while the title text is stored and displayed in green!

Same goes for this Green Eye video.  When a key is pressed, the Green Eye is stored and displayed in green.
But the refresh Green Eye is in orange and can be moved around on the screen with the two thumbwheel knobs on the keyboard!
