4051 EXTENDED FONTS are 7x9 dot matrix fonts. The 4051 BASIC dot matrix text font
is 5x7, which is why the EXTENDED FONTS print slower.

EXTENDED FONTS - BASIC CALLS:

NOFONT - 4051 BASIC 5x7 dot matrix text font
FONT00 - 7x9 standard text font
FONT01 - Superscript and Subscript 7x9 font
FONT02 - Greek 7x9 font
FONT03 - Superscript and Subscript Greek 7x9 font
FONT04 - Graphic Symbol 7x9 font
@FONTN - Selectable 7x9 text font in PRINT statement with each "@n" in the text
         string changing to FONT0n where n=0 to 4
         NOTE: you cannot display "@" in this font mode

CALL "FONT00" through "FONT04" can be individually called with no parameters.
All subsequent PRINT commands will use that font until another CALL "FONT0n"
or CALL "NOFONT" command.

CALL "@FONTN" allows you to switch between the fonts dynamically, within
the text in a PRINT statement.  The fonts are enumerated 0 through 4, so
after that call, adding @0 in a PRINT string selects FONT0 until you type @1
when it switches to FONT1, etc.  This means that you have to give up typing "@"
in any text, since it is used to select between the various fonts.

CALL "NOFONT" or else power cycling the 4051 returns you to the standard
4051 5x7 font.
