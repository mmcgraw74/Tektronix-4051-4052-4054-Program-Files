# Tektronix-4051-4052-4054 service Calibration programs

**************
I rewrote the 4051, 4052, and 4054 service manual Calibration programs and combined each set of programs into a single file.  I also added a User Definable Key menu on the top line above the calibration graphics.  So the calibration instructions on User Definable Keys does not match my new programs - but I believe it works better.  I found typos and missing variables in many of the calibration programs - my new programs fixed these.  

**************
You can either run the file 1 program which will automatically detect the model of your computer and load the appropriate file.

Or run file 2 if you have a 4051, file 3 for 4052 or 4052A, or file 4 for 4054 or 4054A

The instructions for calibration are in the 4051, 4052 or 4054 Service Manuals.

Since I have combined all the programs for each model in a single file - the User Definable Key to access each program are printed at the top of the screen and may not match the instructions.  Press the User Definable Key at the top of the screen to launch each test - or Press User Definable Key 10 to return to the Flash Drive Main Menu - if you are using the Flash Drive.
