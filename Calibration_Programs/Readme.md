# Tektronix-4051-4052-4054 service Calibration programs

**************
I rewrote the 4051, 4052, and 4054 service manual Calibration programs and combined each set of programs into a single file.  I also added a User Definable Key menu on the top line above the calibration graphics.  So the calibration instructions on User Definable Keys does not match my new programs - but I believe it works better.  I found typos and missing variables in many of the calibration programs - my new programs fixed these.
