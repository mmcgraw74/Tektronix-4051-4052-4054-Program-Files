Jos Dreesen 4052/4054/4052A/4054A Multifunction Module ROM Pack - EPROM Images
------
Jos designed his 4052 Multifunction ROM Pack [abbreviated as MFM] based on the Tektronix 4050E01 ROM Expander which I collected and the 4050E01 ROM Expander Instruction Manual posted at [https://w140.com/tekwiki/wiki/4050E01]



This folder contains 4052 ROM Pack Firmware Images I captured from my 4052 ROM Packs - R07 and R08 are from Al Kossow

Each set of ROM PACK firmware images and photos are in separate folders
