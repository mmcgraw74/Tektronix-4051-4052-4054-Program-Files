"NEW" ICE RACES for Tektronix 4050 Computers with R12 Graphics Enhancement ROM Pack
------------------
This is my port of the ICE RACES game designed for the 4054 with Option 30 Dynamic Graphics
https://github.com/mmcgraw74/Tektronix-4051-4052-4054-Program-Files/tree/master/4054_Opt30_GAMES

I modified the game to use R12 Graphics Enhancement ROM PACK

I created four different vector graphics CARS for this game:
- original Option 30 CARs
- 2.5x fewer vector CARs - good for the 4054 with R12 ROM Pack
- 7.5x fewer vector CARs - good for the 4052 with R12
- 17x fewer vector Triangle for CAR1 and Rectangle for CAR2

Instructions for play are in the game.
